These wsd files were recorded to get a better estimate of the magnetic north vector
in the navigation frame of the previous outdoor experiment, and to estimate the 
bias on the magnetometer when mounted to the WASP node.



w315 files 1-8

The 8 files represent stationary trials in 4 locations, aligned to the n-frame then 
rotated 180 degrees in each location before moving to the next location. Used to 
estimate north in the n-frame.



w315 files 9-14

These 6 are used to estimate the magnetic bias on node 315. It was set up on a table 
with a corner bracket, and the axis were rotated to a given direction in the order
x, -x, y, -y, z, -z
